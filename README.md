PowerDocs is free and open-source API/documentation generator for .NET. It takes all the generated XML and assembly files from your project and generate either Markdown or Svelte pages out of it.

## ‚ùì Why another documentation generator?

PowerDocs is supposed to be integrateable in both ways: integrateable in your built website and integrateable in code through Cake.NET, Fake.NET or other means. PowerDocs is a sort of continuation of DefaultDocumentation, which seems to no longer be maintained, but it's also going in a different direction as well.

While DocFX can work great for a lot of people, unfortunately, DocFX can be rather cumbersome to use on systems like Linux. DocFX has also heavy focus on rendering whole websites for you, which doesn't integrate well with already built websites.
